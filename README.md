This is a compiler for a subset of the Manatee Programming Language.

When complete, students will be able to fork this repository to build compilers
and interpreters for the full language.

Manatee is described at http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/manatee.

Here are some of the full language features not implemented in this subset:
