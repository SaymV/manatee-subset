This is a compiler for a subset of the Manatee Programming Language.

The idea is for students to fork this repository to build their own 
compilers and interpreters for the full language.  After all, it can
be argued that extending a compiler for a small language has more
pedagogical value that having students implement everything from scratch.

Manatee is described at http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/manatee.

Here are some of the full language features not implemented in this subset:

* Codepoint escapes in character and string literals        - Added
* Object types and literals                                 - Added - Not generating
* Increment and decrement statements                        - Added - Done!
* Parallel assignment                                       - Added
* Exceptions                                                - Added - Not generating
* Timers                                                    - Added - Not generating
* `unless` and `until` modifiers                            - Added - Not generating
* Bitwise operators                                         - Added
* Modulo operator                                           - Added
* Divides operator                                          - Added
* Bitwise complement operator                               - Added
